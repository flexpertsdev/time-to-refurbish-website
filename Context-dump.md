## A plethora of benefits to a Roof Garden

![](https://www.groundforce1.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Group-2.png)

A well-designed roof garden offers more than just visual appeal ‚Äì it provides a range of environmental and practical benefits. These elevated green spaces improve energy efficiency by insulating buildings, reducing heat absorption, and lowering cooling costs in warmer months. They also help manage stormwater by absorbing rainfall, reducing runoff, and easing pressure on drainage systems. Beyond sustainability, roof gardens create unique spaces, offering a private retreat in urban settings where ground-level gardens may not be an option. By attracting wildlife and enhancing biodiversity, roof gardens can bring a refreshing touch of nature to the busy London life.

## A careful roof garden plan

![](https://www.groundforce1.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Group-2.png)

Designing a roof garden requires a keen understanding of structural integrity, drainage, and plant selection. We assess each space carefully, ensuring it can support the additional load while implementing efficient irrigation and drainage systems to keep your garden flourishing. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a vibrant social space, a calm area, or an eco-conscious green roof that improves insulation and stormwater management, our team combines technical expertise with creative design to make it happen.

A full gut and replace of the bathroom interior
Posted 26 March 2019
I am happy with the work that was done. Good solutions were found and suggested for some of the unique issues that arose during the refurbishment, such as adding some cupboard space into our sink unit and building an enclosure for the downpipes as space was very limited with the old brick enclosure. There are a few areas that I felt let them down which could be improved on. 1. The job took a lot longer than planned. 2. The silicon work at the end ranged from very good to very poor. 3. Some tiles were damaged during the install. 4. Having some more quality control instead of me flagging...

Double story extension on the side and single rear extension.
Posted 03 December 2018
Time To Refurbish has undertake our project as was planned double story extension on the side and single rear extension. During the works we realised that all electrics and plumbing are outdated and need to be changed. It‚Äôs was a massive project to start from foundation, steels and posts installing, walls, floor, roof building. Then we add, changed 3 bathroom and new big kitchen with an island. Plastering and painting throughout, carpet upstairs and same real wood parquet on whole ground floor area (sanded and varnished). The workers were very polite and hard working.

Michael is a superb workman with very high standards. He is always willing to go the extra mile, and is absolutely trustworthy. He can turn his hand to almost every aspect of building, and I can recommend him wholeheartedly.

Extension and partial rebuild throughout - loft access, electrics modernisation and more.
Posted 02 December 2018
Very pleased with quality of work, business relationship and final outcome. While time was occasionally an issue this was often due to their attention to detail. Time To Refurbish Ltd identified various existing problems but nothing unexpected. They worked well with architect and engineer to find solutions and then gave us costed options. Overall we are very pleased with the result and are happy to recommend Time To Refurbish Ltd for similar projects.

Bathroom retiled.
Posted 24 April 2018
Time to Refurbish renovated our house 2 years ago. We asked them to come back to fix an alarm and while they were there they noticed an issue with some of their previous workmanship (which we hadn‚Äôt noticed) and they replaced the whole wall and plaster board free of charge!! Fabulous service and worth every penny!
